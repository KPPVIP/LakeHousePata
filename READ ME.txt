Hi !

Here's my little house on Gordo Mount. 


I've done it first for my FiveM server "Aurora RP" (Curretly in developement) but feel free to use! So, if you find some problem in SP mode, i really don't care xd. 
Btw, this map work perfecly on Fivem.



Requirement :

- Scripthook
- Menyoo
- Map Builder (Community props) [IMPORTANT] (YOU NEED MAP BUILDER ON YOUR FIVEM SERVER)
- Object spawn unlocker




Installation:

 

- For FiveM servers - Drop the folder Lake to your Resources folder. After you have that ready, you will need to start the script on your Server.cfg (ex: "start Lake")


- For Story Mode you will need to install Menyoo first, and then you will drag the Lake.xml file inside of MenyooStuff folder in the Spooner folder.



Enjoy and send me you feedback ! (Screen/video)
